# Introduction to Data Structures
A data structure is a way of organizing, storing, and performing operations on data. 
Operations performed on a data structure include accessing or updating stored data, searching for specific data, inserting new data, and removing data. 

# Introduction to algorithms
An algorithm describes a sequence of steps to solve a computational problem or perform a calculation. 
An algorithm can be described in English, pseudocode, a programming language, hardware, etc. 
A computational problem specifies an input, a question about the input that can be answered using a computer, and the desired output.

# Relation between Data Structures and Algorithms
Algorithms for data structures
Data structures not only define how data is organized and stored, but also the operations performed on the data structure. 
While common operations include inserting, removing, and searching for data, the algorithms to implement those operations are typically specific to each data structure. 
Ex: Appending an item to a linked list requires a different algorithm than appending an item to an array.

Algorithms using data structures
Some algorithms utilize data structures to store and organize data during the algorithm execution. 
Ex: An algorithm that determines a list of the top five salespersons, may use an array to store salespersons sorted by their total sales.
