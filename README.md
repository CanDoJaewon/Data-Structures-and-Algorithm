# Data-Structures-and-Algorithm
My summary through Data Structures and Algorithms with Java

The course organizes with 14 parts:
1. Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms
2. Searching and Algorithm Analysis
3. Sorting Algorithms
4. Lists
5. Stacks and Queues
6. Hash Tables
7. Trees
8. Balanced Trees
9. Heaps and Treaps
10. Sets
11. Graphs
12. Algorithms
13. B-trees
14. Additional Material: Additional sort and list algorithms

The goal is uderstanding deeply how they work and improving data strucuture knowledges for preparing coding challenge.
